# About
A small api I coded as a technical challenge.

## Installing
I used pipenv for package management and both the package file and workspace file have been provided. The basic pip with/without a virtualenv will also work.

To install the package simply run the command

`pipenv install .`

This should install the package and all dependencies. If you want to just install the dependencies, then

`pipenv install`

will work.

## Running

If you've installed the package, then you can run the app using:

`python -m api_challenge`


## Testing

test are integrated into the package and can be run using

`python setup.py pytest`
